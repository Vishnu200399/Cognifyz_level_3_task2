## Overview

This project is part of my completion of Level 3, Task 1 at Cognifyz Technologies, where I created a landing page for a web developer internship using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform).

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The landing page is responsive and works seamlessly on various devices and screen sizes.

- **Interactive Elements**: Utilized JavaScript to create interactive elements and enhance the user experience.

- **Animations**: Incorporated GSAP for smooth animations and transitions.

- **Easy Navigation**: Implemented smooth scrolling navigation to different sections of the page.

## Usage
